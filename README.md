# Catch-The-Light
- The product is a game, the led on the board runs at a fast speed and the player's task will be to catch the predefined led position, after each time the led is caught, the level of play will be more difficult. 
- After reaching the highest limit will get a beautiful led effect. The project uses 8051 microcontrollers to control more than 50 RGB LEDs, using interrupt, and de-noising the button.
