# Catch-The-Light
The product is a game, the led on the board runs at a fast speed and the player's task will be to catch the predefined led position, after each time the led is caught, the level of play will be more difficult. After reaching the highest limit will get a beautiful led effect. The project uses 8051 microcontrollers to control more than 50 RGB LEDs, using interrupt, and de-noising the button. Number of contributors: 3 (I'm the leader)
